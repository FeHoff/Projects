2013-06-19: Andrew Reid just finished uploading the data on peupier. It has been retrieved on May 2013 from the INDI server. I (PB) just started to unpack it in the raw_nii folder.

2013-06-19: Started the conversion in minc. There are 182 subjects in there. 

2013-06-20: Started the transfer on mammouth. All the processing will run there. 

2013-06-20: Started the preprocessing using /svn/projects/andrew/andrew_preprocess_nki_enhanced.m revision 1340.

2013-07-23: Finished the individual QC of coregistration steps.

2013-07-23: Downloaded the motion parameters distributed by the INDI folks at http://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/enhanced/download.html
            More specifically:
            wget ftp://www.nitrc.org//export1/gforge/home/groups/fcon_1000/htdocs/indi/enhanced/data/nki-rs_lite_r1_v1_RfMRI_mx_645_rest_motion_parameters.csv
            wget ftp://www.nitrc.org//export1/gforge/home/groups/fcon_1000/htdocs/indi/enhanced/data/nki-rs_lite_r1_v1_RfMRI_mx_1400_rest_motion_parameters.csv
            wget ftp://www.nitrc.org//export1/gforge/home/groups/fcon_1000/htdocs/indi/enhanced/data/nki-rs_lite_r1_v1_RfMRI_std_2500_rest_motion_parameters.csv
            The files are located is <path nki>/motion
            I generated manually some simplifed versions with only the FD measure
                fd_cpac_mx_645_r1.csv
                fd_cpac_mx_1400_r1.csv
                fd_cpac_std_2500_r1.csv
            Finally I used the script andrew_check_motion.m to generate some head-to-head comparison in the following files:
                motion_niak_vs_cpac_mx_645.csv
                motion_niak_vs_cpac_mx_1400.csv
                motion_niak_vs_cpac_std_2500.csv
            The FD measures generated with the two packages correlated at around 0.95, altough some systematic bias was found 
            between the two packages for mx_645 and std_2500. Interestingly, no bias was observed for mx_1400, which has a 
            higher spatial resolution of 2mm isotropic.
       
2013-07-23: Copied a bunch of templates sent by Andrew a long time ago in /media/database3/nki_enhanced/andrew_time_series
                template_andrew_r1.mnc.gz
                template_andrew_r1.nii.gz
            Then started on mammouth the script script_andrew_nki_enhanced_tseries.m
            to extract time series for all subjects and all runs in /media/database3/nki_enhanced/andrew_time_series

2014-07-21: I am coding a new pipeline to generate voxel-level connectivity maps for Andrew.
            The analysis is going to run on peuplier in /media/database8/nki_enhanced/rmap_cambridge
            For rmap_cambridge the template and seeds are the standard NIAK ones.
            
2014-07-21: I am also going to run a rmap_template_monkey using Andrew's template
            I have copied template_andrew_r1_masked.mnc.gz from the andrew_tseries_nki_enhanced experiment. 
            I have prepared a file called list_seeds_template_monkey.csv with a parcel in the PCC and one in the aMPFC.
